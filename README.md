# AI-Powered Lead Qualification and Funnel Prediction System.

>“Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We’re nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on.” <br>

This project is one of the first few steps my team and I are taking to move towards Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, while learning all of its capabilities and be able to use it for our own betterment.

## Project Overview:
This project involves a modular structure built using different ML models that streamline lead management.
It consists of three key layers that analyze, score and predict lead behaviour for improvised marketing performance.

This project is ideal for marketing and sales teams seeking data-driven insights to boost conversion rates and optimize funnel engagement.


## Components:

**- Lead Conversion Predictor-**
  Uses classification models to predict the **probability of a lead becoming a customer** based on demographic, behavioral, and campaign data.

**- Funnel Stage Classifier-**
  **Classifies each lead into predefined sales funnel stages** like Awareness, Interest, Decision, or Action, Intelligence using multi-class classification techniques.

**- Lead Scoring Model**
  **Assigns a numerical value (0–100) to each lead**, quantifying lead quality and engagement level. Scores are based on various features such as interaction frequency, source quality, and prior history.


## Workflow:

1) Data Ingestion & Cleaning
   - Ingest leads data from CRM, marketing tools, or manual inputs.
   - Clean and normalize the dataset for consistent model performance.

2) Model Pipeline Execution
   - Leads are passed through the three ML models in sequence.
   - Intermediate outputs are stored and can be reused or tuned independently.

3) Insights Interface
   - A simple dashboard presents lead scores, predicted funnel stages, and likelihood of conversion.
   - Exports insights or integrates with existing CRM via API.


## Key Features
 - Accurate lead scoring using AI
 - Funnel visualization and stage mapping
 - Continuous learning via retraining module
 - Easy API access and CRM integration (e.g., HubSpot, Zoho, Salesforce)
 - GDPR-compliant data handling


##  Why It Matters
- Focus sales efforts on high-potential leads
- Reduce manual workload with automation
- Increase ROI on marketing campaigns
- Identify funnel drop-off points to fix conversion leaks
