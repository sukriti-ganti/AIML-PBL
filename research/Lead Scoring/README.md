# Lead Scoring - Research work!
## Here I have sorted out 2 interesting works on this topic, one is an article and the other is a Research paper.


### 1.  The first piece of reference was from an article released by *Super AGI*
[The Future of Lead Scoring â€“ SuperAGI](https://superagi.com/the-future-of-lead-scoring-how-ai-is-transforming-b2b-marketing-trends-in-2025-and-beyond/)  

This article provides an overview and insights into SuperAGI, an All-in-One Agentic GTM (Go-To-Market) and CRM Platform that is at the forefront of transforming B2B marketing and sales through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It particularly highlights the revolutionary impact of AI-powered lead scoring

The website is primarily about lead scoring, specifically AI-powered lead scoring and how it is transforming B2B marketing.

The content delves into:  
* The limitations of traditional lead scoring methods.  
* The rise and benefits of AI-powered lead intelligence.  
* Key AI innovations reshaping lead scoring, such as predictive analytics, machine learning, intent data monitoring, natural language processing (NLP), cross-channel attribution, and real-time scoring.  
* Strategies for implementing AI-driven lead scoring.  
* Measuring the ROI and performance of AI lead scoring.  
* A case study on SuperAGI's own transformation of B2B lead qualification using AI lead scoring technology.  

The website also positions SuperAGI as an **"All-in-One Agentic GTM (Go-To-Market) and CRM Platform"** that integrates AI for various sales and marketing features, with lead scoring being a central component.
